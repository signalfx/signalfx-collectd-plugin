SignalFx Meta-Data Plugin
==============================

Provides meta-data about host and will send collectd notifications to SignalFx if configured to do so.

Example Config:

```
LoadPlugin python
<Plugin python>
  ModulePath "/opt/signalfx-collectd-plugin"
  LogTraces true
  Interactive false
  Import "signalfx_metadata"
  <Module signalfx_metadata>
    URL "https://ingest.signalfx.com/v1/collectd"
    Token "<<<<<<INSERT_TOKEN_HERE>>>>>>"
    Notifications true
    NotifyLevel "OKAY"
  </Module>
</Plugin>
```

For metadata:

* ProcessInfo: do we want to collect process information, true or false. Default is true.
* Notifications: do we want to emit notifications from the plugin true or false. Default is false.
  Note, the plugin will send it's own metadata as events in addition to this.
* URL: where to emit notifications via json to. The example url is the default.
* Token: api token from signalfx to authenticate. No default. Required for meta-data.
* Interval: how often you want the sfx plugin to collect and send data. Default is 10.
* NotifyLevel: If you want to emit notifications beyond the ones generated by this plugin, set to
  the appropriate level. "OKAY" would mean all notifications are emitted.  "ERROR" would just be
  error.  "WARNING" would include "ERROR" and "WARNING".
